##### On Hold

> Putting the mock sites on hold since they're all so close to my heart. Like past lives of sorts. Once a photographer, no time to learn to bake, I suck at cutting hair, failed Philo trying to become a lawyer, and I so far I've spent more money on learning and buying resources than earning as a freelancer. I'm putting waaay to much work into a "mock site" becuase its kinda like it is mine
